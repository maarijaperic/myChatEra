# Terms of Service - GPT Wrapped

**Last Updated: November 2025**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By using MyChatEra AI ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

## 2. What is MyChatEra AI?

MyChatEra AI is an application that analyzes your ChatGPT conversation history to provide insights, statistics, and personalized analytics about your usage patterns.

**IMPORTANT:** MyChatEra AI is **NOT** affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI, ChatGPT, or any of their affiliates. Your use of ChatGPT is subject to OpenAI's own Terms of Service.

## 3. How It Works

1. The App provides you with a secure, in-app web browser interface that allows you to sign in to your ChatGPT account directly through OpenAI's official website (chatgpt.com). Here's how the process works:

2. You initiate the login process within the App, which opens a secure web browser view displaying ChatGPT's official login page.

3. You enter your ChatGPT credentials directly into OpenAI's official login interface. Your credentials are entered only on OpenAI's website and are never stored, accessed, or transmitted by our App.

4. Once you successfully authenticate with OpenAI, the App retrieves your conversation metadata (such as conversation titles, dates, and message counts) using standard API requests that you authorize through your authenticated session.

5. The App processes this conversation data locally on your device to generate statistics and insights about your ChatGPT usage patterns.

6. For premium features, the App uses OpenAI's API (through our secure proxy server) to generate AI-powered insights based on your conversation data. The proxy server acts as an intermediary and does not store your data.

7. All data, including your conversation information and generated insights, is stored exclusively on your device using secure local storage. We do not maintain any servers, databases, or cloud storage containing your conversation content.

**IMPORTANT: We do NOT store:**

• Your OpenAI password or credentials
